Project Idea: “Smart Weather APP – A Weather App That Helps You Plan Better”

We have build a weather application that provides real-time weather updates for users based on their location. 
The app will feature a user-friendly interface and utilize a weather API to fetch the latest weather data.

## 🖼️ Project Preview
The main interface includes:
- Search bar to enter a city  
- Weather display (temperature, description, icon)  
- A dedicated **advice box** that explains the conditions

## Features
- Real-time weather updates
- Location-based weather information
- User-friendly interface
- Outfit recommendations (“It’s cold today — wear a jacket!”)

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Weather API

The Problem we solved:
Many people check the weather every day, but traditional weather apps only show temperature and rain chances. 
They don’t help users decide what to wear, when to go out, or how to prepare for sudden weather changes.
We created a simple app that not only shows the forecast but also gives personalized suggestions and alerts based on user preferences.
